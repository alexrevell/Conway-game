# Conway-game
My version of the classic petri-dish life simulation

*** Having been shown this cool life simulation app early on in my time at Enspiral Dev Academy, I'm keen to have a go at coding it myself.

# Basic tenets are:
* cells are randomly generated at first, either dead or alive.
* each 'turn' of life:
* if a cell has less than two neighbours, it dies due to underpopulation
* if it has more than 3 neighbours, it dies due to overpopulation
* if a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours, it regenerates into life.

Hopefully this will be a pleasure to watch, as it was when I first saw it, and every time since!


# What I'll be using and trying to get out of it:

* I'll just run it as a console app
* I'm keen to try it in JavaScript first, and then maybe Ruby too.
* It has a reasonably algorithm-heavy aspect to it, which I haven't done for a while
* I may try and add something a little unusual to it, maybe some more randomness after the initial population
* potentially convert it later into a web app with css to display it in a cooler way
